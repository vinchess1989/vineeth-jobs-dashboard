"""Authenticated access to this repo's Firestore database for Python scripts.

Firestore security rules only let the dashboard's allow-listed Google accounts read or write
(tightened 2026-09-28; before that shared_state / user_feedback were readable and writable by
anyone on the internet). Scripts authenticate as the Firebase project's service account instead
- service-account requests are authorized by IAM and bypass the security rules.

The key file lives OUTSIDE every repo, at ~/.secrets/<project-id>-sa.json (Firebase Console ->
Project settings -> Service accounts -> Generate new private key). Never commit it.
